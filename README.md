# Channel 329: Crimes of the Magically Inclined
A detective game for the DS. 

# About the Game
The story follows a trio of young newscasters who want to investigate the mystery surrounding disappearance of a criminal organization, and the player will be able to swap between the trio members as they explore different parts of the area both separately and together. There will also be moments when the player will need to gather information as one character to be delivered to another character that needs it to proceed. The story is planned to be partially linear with open world exploration, and depending on the success of the interactions, the player will have access to branching story paths. Channel 329 encourages different styles of how the player will want to carry out the investigation, so that there is no objectively correct approach to solving the mystery.
